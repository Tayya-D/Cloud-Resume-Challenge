# Cloud-Resume-Challenge

## Description
Following the Cloud Resume Challenge - I have put together my CV using a template that I liked as the base and then editted it to how I liked.
This included removing a lot of the pages included in the initial template and amending the code for the design and content via HTML and CSS.

## Breakdown of the Challenge
