# Cloud-Resume-Challenge

## Description
Following the Cloud Resume Challenge - I have put together my CV using a template that I liked as the base and then editted it to how I liked.
This included removing a lot of the pages included in the initial template and amending the code for the design and content via HTML and CSS.

## Breakdown and Walkthrough of the Challenge
1) Create your Resume/CV with HTML and CSS (COMPLETE)

2) Create a static Website deloyed on AWS S3 (COMPLETE)
   - Changed region to Europe(London) for faster load times
   - Named S3 bucket <name>-cloud-resume-challenge (fyi AWS doesn't accepts names w/ caps)
   - Add a tag with "Key: project" and "Value: Cloud Resume Challenge"
   - Set default encryption 
   - Upload website folder
   - Set "Static website hosting" to "Enable" in the Properties of the S3 Bucket and set the index document name to index.html (if yours is different make sure you use the right filename) + save changes (UPDATE - can set this to Disabled)
   - Navigate to your index.html in Objects in your S3 Bucket - click on the Object URL (you should get a XML file error - beacuse the bucket is not public. We can fix this via CloudFront in the next step) 

3) Website should use HTTPS for security via AWS CloudFront (COMPLETE) 
   - CloudFront is an AWS service that helps deliver data at a low latency and higher transfer speed.
   - Navigate to CloudFront, create distribution > origin domain is Your_S3_Bucket.s3.your_region.amazonaws.com
   - Set Origin access to "Origin access control settings(recommended)" 
      - This gives your CloudFront distribution access to your S3 Bucket to read objects (Right now nothing has access to read anything from your S3 Bucket. But origin access control setting allows the distribution to access the S3 Bucket)
      - Origin access control > create new AOC (CloudFront will provide a policy statement after the distribution has been created)
      - Viewer protocol policy > Allow only HTTPS access 
      - Create distribution > Copy the policy CloudFront provides to update your S3 Bucket with
      - Open a new AWS console window > S3 > your_bucket > Permissions > Edit Bucket Policy + paste the copied CloudFront policy > save changes (it should look like something like the cloudfrontpolicy.json file in this repo)
      - UPDATE - Set a Default root object > set as your index.html (this will point the distibution to the desired page - in this case its our cv)
      - At this point you can test the distribution URL to see if your resume loads
         - I had an issue where I encountered an "Access Denied" error message and proceeded to troubleshoot and went as far as to create an AppendIndexHTML function - the issue still persisted. 
         - The issue was that all my files (including the index.html) were in a parent folder. So I deleted everything in the bucket and reuploaded the files as the are; the only folder I had was the /images folder --> this ended up fixing my "Access Denied" error and fully loaded my resume as expected.  

4) Create a custom DNS domain name via AWS Route53
- This step will also us to set a custom URL for our website
- Navigate to Route 53 > register domain > enter domain name (I chose "<domain-name>.click" - this only costs Â£3 to run yearly) > checkout (I set auto-renew to No - I'll see where I am in a year and renew if I want when the time comes)
- It took about 10 minutes for the domain to be registered
- You do need to verify your email to avoid domain suspension - you can click "send email again" from your registered domain's page to get the email sent out if you didn't already get it (it took about 5 minutes for it to get to my inbox)
- In the CloudFront settings for your distribution, the Alternate domain names is not set. Select edit and Add item under CNAME (I chose resume.<name>.click)
- Request SSL Certificate > Request a public cert > Set fully qualified domain name (I set this as *.<name>.click  The wildcard (*.) will allow you to use this SSL for other domain ending in "<name>.click") > set tags "key: project" and "value: Cloud Resume Challenge" > Request and wait for validation 
   - DNS Validation: If you're using DNS validation (which we are), the process is usually quicker, especially if you're using Amazon Route 53 as your DNS provider.
   - After adding the required CNAME records, validation can often complete within minutes to a few hours - However, it's important to note that while the validation process itself may be quick, the certificate status might continue to display as "Pending validation" for up to 30 minutes, even after successful validation. (so its a waiting game rn -> validation completed after ....)

5) Create a visitor counter via JavaScript

6) Create a AWS DynamoDB to store and update the counter

7) Create an API that accepts requests from your web app and communicate with the DB using AWS API Gateway and Lambda

8) Use Python to code your Lambda functions

9) Include some tests in your Python code 

10) Configure your API resources using Infrastructure as Code via Terraform
11) Create a GitHub repo to manage your CI/CD Back-End + GitHub Actions
12) Create a GitHub repo to manage your CI/CD Front-End to for your website + GitHub Actions
