When using git, start at root: ~ (make sure git is initialised via "git init")
Then cd to your repo - you should end up on the "main" branch by default
If you do not have a repo and you want to create one: 
    1) create on GitHub directly then clone the repo via "git clone <link to repo>"
    2) or create the repo via VScode first and then push it along with your initial commit
        - (will add details once I have tested this myself)
    3) you now have the up to date main branch of your repo and can start adding files and resources

    key commands:
    git status --> checks whether you are up to date with main and if there are any changes that are unstaged (these will appear RED)
    git add <filename> --> to stage and add your changes to the queue essentially (you can rerun "git status" again and the staged changes will appear GREEN)
    git commit - m "<message>" --> this command submits/commits the queued changes with an informative message
    git push <origin main / or branch-name > --> this command allows you to PUSH your changes to the GitHub repo
