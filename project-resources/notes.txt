When using git, start at root: ~ (make sure git is initialised via "git init")
Then cd to your repo - you should end up on the "main" branch by default
If you do not have a repo and you want to create one: 
    1) create on GitHub directly then clone the repo via "git clone <link to repo>"
    2) or create the repo via VScode first and then push it along with your initial commit
        - (will add details once I have tested this myself)
    3) you now have the up to date main branch of your repo and can start adding files and resources

    key commands:
    git status --> checks whether you are up to date with main and if there are any changes that are unstaged (these will appear RED)
    git add <filename> --> to stage and add your changes to the queue essentially (you can rerun "git status" again and the staged changes will appear GREEN)
    git commit - m "<message>" --> this command submits/commits the queued changes with an informative message
    git push <origin main / or branch-name > --> this command allows you to PUSH your changes to the GitHub repo

Walkthrough Simpilified

Here’s a polished and professional version of your README file for GitHub. I've reorganized and formatted it for better readability and presentation:

# Cloud Resume Challenge

## Description
This project is part of the **Cloud Resume Challenge**, where I built and deployed my resume as a static website using AWS services. The website includes a visitor counter powered by AWS DynamoDB, Lambda, and API Gateway, with CI/CD pipelines managed via GitHub Actions. The infrastructure is provisioned using Terraform.

---

## Prerequisites
- **AWS Account**
- **Visual Studio Code (VSCode)**
- **GitHub Account**
- **Terraform** (for Infrastructure as Code)
- **AWS CLI** (for local configuration)

---

## Project Breakdown

### 1. **Resume/CV Creation**
   - Created a resume using HTML and CSS.
   - Customized a template to suit my preferences, removing unnecessary pages and modifying the design.

### 2. **Static Website Deployment on AWS S3**
   - Created an S3 bucket in the **Europe (London)** region for faster load times.
   - Enabled static website hosting and configured the bucket to serve the `index.html` file.
   - Set default encryption and added tags for project identification.

### 3. **HTTPS via AWS CloudFront**
   - Configured a CloudFront distribution to serve the website over HTTPS.
   - Set up **Origin Access Control (OAC)** to allow CloudFront to access the S3 bucket.
   - Resolved an "Access Denied" error by ensuring files were uploaded directly to the bucket (except for the `/images` folder).

### 4. **Custom DNS with Route 53 and SSL via ACM**
   - Registered a custom domain (`<name>.click`) using AWS Route 53.
   - Requested an SSL certificate via AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) for the domain.
   - Configured CloudFront to use the custom domain and SSL certificate.
   - Manually added a CNAME record in Route 53 to point to the CloudFront distribution.

### 5. **Visitor Counter with DynamoDB**
   - Created a DynamoDB table (`cloudresume-test`) to store and update the visitor count.
   - Added an initial item with a `views` attribute to track the count.

### 6. **API with AWS Lambda and API Gateway**
   - Created a Lambda function (`cloudresume-test-api`) to fetch and update the visitor count.
   - Configured the Lambda function URL with **CORS** to allow access only from the custom domain.
   - Resolved region mismatch issues between Lambda and DynamoDB by ensuring both were in the **Europe (London)** region.

### 7. **JavaScript Visitor Counter**
   - Added JavaScript to fetch the visitor count from the Lambda function and display it on the website.
   - Fixed issues with CSS styling and added error handling for failed API requests.

### 8. **CI/CD for Front-End with GitHub Actions**
   - Created a GitHub Actions workflow (`front-end-cicd.yml`) to automate deployment to the S3 bucket.
   - Configured GitHub Secrets for AWS credentials to securely authenticate the workflow.
   - Resolved an ACL error by enabling ACLs on the S3 bucket.

### 9. **Python Tests**
   - Added tests for the Lambda function to ensure functionality.

### 10. **Infrastructure as Code with Terraform**
   - Created Terraform configuration files (`main.tf` and `provider.tf`) to provision AWS resources.
   - Set up an IAM role and policy for the Lambda function.
   - Resolved permission issues by adding `dynamodb:query` to the IAM policy.

### 11. **CI/CD for Back-End with GitHub Actions**
   - Work in progress to automate the deployment of back-end resources using GitHub Actions.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Tayya-D/Cloud-Resume-Challenge.git
   ```

2. Set up AWS CLI and Terraform locally:
   - Install [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html).
   - Install [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli).

3. Configure AWS CLI profile:
   ```sh
   aws configure --profile <profile-name>
   ```

4. Initialize Terraform:
   ```sh
   cd infra
   terraform init
   terraform plan
   terraform apply
   ```

---

## Technologies Used
- **AWS Services**: S3, CloudFront, Route 53, ACM, DynamoDB, Lambda, API Gateway, IAM.
- **Front-End**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
- **Back-End**: Python, Terraform.
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions.
- **Version Control**: Git.

---

## Challenges and Learnings
- Resolved region mismatches between AWS services.
- Fixed ACL and permission issues for S3 and Lambda.
- Learned to configure CORS and secure API endpoints.
- Gained hands-on experience with Terraform for Infrastructure as Code.

---

## Future Improvements
- Add a manual approval step in GitHub Actions for deployments.
- Implement additional tests for the Lambda function.
- Enhance the website design and add more interactive features.
